# Hi there, I’m Aqua
I break things until they start working.
Mostly into C++, a bit of C, Haskell, and whatever else I decide to poke with a stick, full language list is too huge.

Currently fighting with codebases that were never meant to compile, and somehow making them do just that.

Gentoo enjoyer, i3 dweller, and occasional reverse engineer when I get too curious.

When I’m not fixing someone else’s design mistakes, I’m usually making my own, a small tool, or something that definitely shouldn’t exist but does anyway.

## Things I like
Clean code that feels like poetry

Systems that just work

Low-level magic

Sandwiches that don’t fall apart

## Things I don’t like
Premature abstractions

“It works on my machine” (it’s always my machine that breaks it)

## Master and a memory leak
A student approaches master.

Student: "Master, how do I write a program that doesn't leak memory?"

Master: "First, tell me: where does memory go when freed?"

Student: "Back to the system"

Master: "And where did it come from?"

Student: "From the system"

Master: "You cannot lose what has never gone"

Student: "But what if I allocate and never free?"

Master: "What came, goes. What goes, came. This is the way"

Student: "So I should carefully manage my lifetime?"

Master: "Does an ocean care about every raindrop that has fallen into it?"

Student: "But it contains them all"

Master: "Write code like an ocean. Every drop must return back home"

Upon hearing that the student achieved enlightenment.
