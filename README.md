# Hi there, I’m Aqua
I break things until they start working.
Mostly into C++, a bit of C, Haskell, and whatever else I decide to poke with a stick, full language list is too huge.

Currently fighting with codebases that were never meant to compile, and somehow making them do just that.

Gentoo enjoyer, i3 dweller, and occasional reverse engineer when I get too curious.

When I’m not fixing someone else’s design mistakes, I’m usually making my own, a small tool, or something that definitely shouldn’t exist but does anyway.

## Things I like
Clean code that feels like poetry

Systems that just work

Low-level magic

Sandwiches that don’t fall apart

## Things I don’t like
Premature abstractions

“It works on my machine” (it’s always my machine that breaks it)

## All the other stuff
Repositiories here are mostly just mirrors from my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/baka.senpai.lts)
